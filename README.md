# CSF425_Assignment1

## Problem Statement:

Exploring the impact of Skip Connections in Multi Layer Perceptron networks. 

1. Comparing the performance of MLPs with skip connections to those without skip connections.

2. Analysing multiple different types of skip connections (at least 2) and compare their performance.

3. Performing ablation studies over different (at least 2) characteristics of skip connections (e.g. number of layers skipped) to see how this effects performance.

4. Attempt to explain, through an experiment of your own, why Skip Connections help or hurt. Here, we have used VAE as a generative model
